    "# Saga\n",
    "Saga is a design pattern that manages data consistency across multiple services without the use of distributed transactions. It ensures system consistency be executing a series of operations in a sequence and compensating for any failures by reversing previous actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Saga**: A series of operations that must be executed in a specific order.\n",
    "- **Compensation Steps**: Actions taken to reverse the effects of previous steps if an error occurs.\n",
    "- **No Distributed Transactions**: Does not use traditional ACID transactions across multiple services.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Saga?\n",
    "A Saga is a sequence of local transactions where each transaction updates data within a single service. After each local transaction completes, it triggers the next transaction throught messaging or events. If one transaction fails, the Saga executes compensating transaction to undo the effects of the preceding transactions, maintaining the system's consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Sagas\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choreography-Based Sagas\n",
    "Each service performs its transaction and then publish an event to trigger the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow: Decentralized, each service away only the next step\n",
    "\n",
    "User Case: Suitable for simple workflows with a clear progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Simplicity in small systems.\n",
    "- No central coordinator required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Difficult to manage as complexity grows.\n",
    "- Harder to track and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Orchestration-Based Sagas\n",
    "A central Saga orchestrator manages the sequences of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow: Centralize control over the entire Saga execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Preferred for complex workflows requiring coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Clear visibility of the process flow.\n",
    "- Easier to handle complex logic and compensations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Single point of control, which could become a bottleneck.\n",
    "- Increase complexity in the orchestrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of How Sagas Work\n",
    "Placing an online order that involves multiple services (Order Service, Payment Service, Inventory Service, Shipping Service).\n",
    "1. Order Service: Creates an order and initiates the Saga.\n",
    "2. Payment Services: Processes payment.\n",
    "- - If payment fails, compensatubg transaction: Cancel the order.\n",
    "3. Inventory Service: Reserves Items.\n",
    "- - If reservation fails, compensating transaction: Refund payment, cancel the order.\n",
    "4. Shipping Service: Schedules delivery.\n",
    "- - If scheduling fails, compensating transaction: Release inventory, refund payment, cancel the order.\n",
    " \n",
    "Each step commits locally, and failures trigger compensating actions to rollback previous steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compensating Transactions\n",
    "Undo the effects of a previous transaction in the Saga.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charateristics:\n",
    "- Must be explicitly defined for each transaction that can be compensated.\n",
    "- Should be idempotent and handle partial failures gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design Considerations:\n",
    "- Not all operations are easily reversible (eg., sneding an email).\n",
    "- Side effects may require additional handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checkpoints\n",
    "When a Saga is redriven after a failure, it utilizes checkpoints to resume execution from the point of failure rather from starting over from the beginning. "
