    " * {@code synchronized} methods and statements, but with extended capabilities.\n",
    " *\n",
    " * A {@code ReentrantLock} is owned by the thread last successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking\n",
    " * {@code lock} will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when the lock is not owned by another thread. The mehtod will return\n",
    " * immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can be checked by using methods {@lind #isHeldCurrentThread}, and {@link #getHoldCount}.\n",
    " *\n",
    " * The constructor for this class accepts an optional fairness parameter. When set {@code true}, under\n",
    " * contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting thread. Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular\n",
    " * access order. Programs use fair locks accessed by many threads may display overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much\n",
    " * slower) then those using the default setting, but have smaller variance in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of\n",
    " * starvation. Not however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee fairness of thread scheduling. This, one of many threads using a fair lock may\n",
    " * obtain it multiple times in succession while other active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the lock.\n",
    " * Also note that the untimed {@link #tryLock() tryLock} method does not honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock is available even if other threads are waiting.\n",
    " *\n",
    " * It is recommended practice to always immediately follow a call to {@code lock} with a {@code try} block, mos typically in a before/after construction such as:\n",
