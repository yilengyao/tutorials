      "Alright, let me tackle this query about the top five highest-grossing animated films of 2025. The user is asking for a list that's specific to 2025, which means I need to ensure the data provided pertains accurately to that year.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, looking at the tool responses from DuckDuckGo, several sources are cited. Wikipedia mentions \"Ne Zha 2\" surpassing other films and becoming the highest-grossing animated film as of early 2025. Another entry on JustJared lists \"Ne Zha 2\" with a gross of $1.72 billion as of February 20, 2025. This suggests it's at the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, there are mentions of other films like \"Inside Out 2\" being noted in one source as the highest even though Ne Zha 2 overtook it. The Wikipedia entry about box office number ones in the U.S. lists \"Captain America: Brave New World\" as high-grossing domestically for Disney, but since that's a live-action film (part of Captain America franchise), unless it's an animated/live action hybrid, it might not count towards the pure animated list. I need to check if that's considered animated here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dexerto article talks about 2024 having success with various sequels like Moana 2 and Despicable Me 4, but the user is asking for 2025, so those might be older entries unless they have continued 2025 earnings. The Statista entry notes \"Inside Out 2\" as #1 as of January 2025, suggesting it's the previous top before Ne Zha 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at another source from What's After the Movie, their page for 2025 is listed but incomplete in the provided summary (like no titles after rank 1). The IMDB list and the-numbers.com site also refer to 2025 data. \n",
      "\n",
      "I need to compile these sources carefully. Possible contenders beyond Ne Zha 2 might include Inside Out 2, Moana 2, Despicable Me 4, Kung Fu Panda 4 (they were big in 2024 but maybe still grossing into 2025). However, the IMDB list's detail isn't given here. Wikipedia mentions \"Ne Zha 2\" surpassing Inside Out 2 as of early 2025, so perhaps a shift happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, checking for any animated Captain America film? The entry on Captain America: Brave New World is listed under highest-grossing in the US domestic charts but it's possible that isn't an animated movie. Looking at details, Ne Zha is from China, which makes sense as breaking Disney's streak (mentioned in Wikipedia). Disney films like Inside Out 2 are part of their 2024 portfolio but still ongoing into 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting this together, the top five would likely be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ne Zha 2 – leading with over $1.7B by early 2025\n",
      "2. Inside Out 2 – previously held top spot\n",
      "3. Moana 2 (maybe?)\n",
      "4. Despicable Me 4\n",
      "5. Kung Fu Panda 4? \n",
      "\n",
      "Or perhaps other films like \"Turning Red\" sequels or others, but given the data supplied, those four would fit alongside Ne Zha and Inside Out. Need to note that some might have overlapping years or continued earnings from previous years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if any of these entries could be international co-productions or animated/live-action blends affecting their status. Since the query specifies animated films, I can safely list Moana 2, Despicable Me, etc., as they are animated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Potential issue: The Statista data says Inside Out is top until Jan 2025, then Ne Zha overtakes it in February (from JustJared). So ranking order may have changed. Also, other entries like \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" were huge in late 2023 and might still be earning in 2025? But that's probably way past its release date by then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on tool responses provided, the top five are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ne Zha 2\n",
      "2. Inside Out 2 (if it held onto second place)\n",
      "Then others like Moana 2 or other mentioned films from 2024 sequels which may have carried over revenue into early 2025. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps \"Turning Red\" 2? The user's sources don't name more beyond these.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll structure the answer listing Ne Zha as #1, then follow with Inside Out 2, and a couple of others based on mentions in the tool data. Need to mention that some films might have been released in late previous year but continued into this one, affecting earnings.\n",

       " ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(content='<think>\\nAlright, let me tackle this query about the top five highest-grossing animated films of 2025. The user is asking for a list that\\'s specific to 2025, which means I need to ensure the data provided pertains accurately to that year.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the tool responses from DuckDuckGo, several sources are cited. Wikipedia mentions \"Ne Zha 2\" surpassing other films and becoming the highest-grossing animated film as of early 2025. Another entry on JustJared lists \"Ne Zha 2\" with a gross of $1.72 billion as of February 20, 2025. This suggests it\\'s at the top.\\n\\nNext, there are mentions of other films like \"Inside Out 2\" being noted in one source as the highest even though Ne Zha 2 overtook it. The Wikipedia entry about box office number ones in the U.S. lists \"Captain America: Brave New World\" as high-grossing domestically for Disney, but since that\\'s a live-action film (part of Captain America franchise), unless it\\'s an animated/live action hybrid, it might not count towards the pure animated list. I need to check if that\\'s considered animated here.\\n\\nThe Dexerto article talks about 2024 having success with various sequels like Moana 2 and Despicable Me 4, but the user is asking for 2025, so those might be older entries unless they have continued 2025 earnings. The Statista entry notes \"Inside Out 2\" as #1 as of January 2025, suggesting it\\'s the previous top before Ne Zha 2.\\n\\nLooking at another source from What\\'s After the Movie, their page for 2025 is listed but incomplete in the provided summary (like no titles after rank 1). The IMDB list and the-numbers.com site also refer to 2025 data. \\n\\nI need to compile these sources carefully. Possible contenders beyond Ne Zha 2 might include Inside Out 2, Moana 2, Despicable Me 4, Kung Fu Panda 4 (they were big in 2024 but maybe still grossing into 2025). However, the IMDB list\\'s detail isn\\'t given here. Wikipedia mentions \"Ne Zha 2\" surpassing Inside Out 2 as of early 2025, so perhaps a shift happened.\\n\\nAlso, checking for any animated Captain America film? The entry on Captain America: Brave New World is listed under highest-grossing in the US domestic charts but it\\'s possible that isn\\'t an animated movie. Looking at details, Ne Zha is from China, which makes sense as breaking Disney\\'s streak (mentioned in Wikipedia). Disney films like Inside Out 2 are part of their 2024 portfolio but still ongoing into 2025.\\n\\nPutting this together, the top five would likely be:\\n\\n1. Ne Zha 2 – leading with over $1.7B by early 2025\\n2. Inside Out 2 – previously held top spot\\n3. Moana 2 (maybe?)\\n4. Despicable Me 4\\n5. Kung Fu Panda 4? \\n\\nOr perhaps other films like \"Turning Red\" sequels or others, but given the data supplied, those four would fit alongside Ne Zha and Inside Out. Need to note that some might have overlapping years or continued earnings from previous years.\\n\\nI should also consider if any of these entries could be international co-productions or animated/live-action blends affecting their status. Since the query specifies animated films, I can safely list Moana 2, Despicable Me, etc., as they are animated. \\n\\nPotential issue: The Statista data says Inside Out is top until Jan 2025, then Ne Zha overtakes it in February (from JustJared). So ranking order may have changed. Also, other entries like \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" were huge in late 2023 and might still be earning in 2025? But that\\'s probably way past its release date by then.\\n\\nBased on tool responses provided, the top five are:\\n\\n1. Ne Zha 2\\n2. Inside Out 2 (if it held onto second place)\\nThen others like Moana 2 or other mentioned films from 2024 sequels which may have carried over revenue into early 2025. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Turning Red\" 2? The user\\'s sources don\\'t name more beyond these.\\n\\nI\\'ll structure the answer listing Ne Zha as #1, then follow with Inside Out 2, and a couple of others based on mentions in the tool data.
