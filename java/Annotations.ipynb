Funcitonal interfaces play a key role in Java's approach to functional programming.\n",

    "Uses of Functional Interfaces\n",
    "1. Lambda Expressions: Functional interfaces allows you to use lambda expressions. Which provide a clear and concise way to represent instances of single-method interfaces (functional interfaces) using an expression.\n",
    "2. Method References: They enable method references, another way to simplify code by refactoring to methods rather than usign a lambda expression.\n",
    "3. Stream API and Functional Programming: Functional interfaces are extensively used in the Stream API and other parts of the Java standard library that support functional programming paradigms.\n",
