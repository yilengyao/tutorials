    "### find function\n",
    "`db.<collectionname>.find(query, fields, limit, skip, batchsize, options)` is a MongoDB query method used to retrieve documents from a collection. This method returns all documents that match the provided query criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Usage\n",
    "1. Find All Documents: Retrieve all documents in a collection.\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.<collectionname>.find()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find Documents with Query: retrieve documents that match specific criteria.\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.<collectionname>.find(query)\n",
    "```\n",
    "query are key value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find Documents with Specific criteria\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.users.find({ age: 25 })\n",
    "```\n",
    "Retrieve users with age of 25\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find Documents with Multiple Criteria\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.users.find({ age: 25, status: \"A\" })\n",
    "```\n",
    "Retrieve users with age of 25 and status \"A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find Documents with Range Query\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.users.find({ age: { $gte: 18, $lte: 30 } })\n",
    "```\n",
    "This retieves all documents in the `users` collection where the `age` si between `18` and `30` inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find Documents with an Array field\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.posts.find({ tage: \"mongodb\" })\n",
    "```\n",
    "This retrieves all documents in the `posts` collection where the `tags` array contains the value \"mongodb\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Projections\n",
    "Control which fields are returned in the documents by using a projection. If the field does not exist in the document, the document only returns the key value pair of the existing fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Return only specific fields\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.users.find({ age: 25 }, { name: 1, age: 1, _id: 0 })\n",
    "```\n",
    "This retrieves all documents in the `users` collection where the `age` is `25`, but only returns the `name` and `age` fields, excluding the `_id` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limit and Sort\n",
    "You can limit the number of documents returned and sort them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Limit Results\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.users.find().limit(10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This retrieves only the first `10` documents from the `users` collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sort Results\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.users.find.sort({ age: -1 })\n",
    "```\n",
    "This retrieves all documents from the `users` collection sorted by `age` in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining Limit and Sort\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.users.find().sort({ age: 1}).limit(5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This retrieve the first `5` documents from the `users` collection sorted by `age` in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pagination\n",
    "Pagination in MongoDB is sued to retrieve a subset of results form a larger dataset, typically by specifying the number of results to skip and the number of results to return. This is useful for displaying large datasets in smaller, more manageable chunks, such as pages in a web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Pagination <br>\n",
    "You can achieve pagination using the `skip()` and `limit()` methods.\n",
    "1. `skip(m)`: Skips the first m documents.\n",
    "2. `limit(n)`: Limits the result set to n documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex <br>\n",
    "Assume you have a collection named `users` with many documents, and you want to paginate through them , displaying 10 users per page.\n",
    "1. Page 1: Skip 0 documents, limit 10.\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.users.find().skip(0).limit(10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Page 2: Skip 10 documents, limit 10.\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.users.find().skip(10).limit(10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Page 3: Skip 20 documents, limit 10.\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.users.find().skip(10).limit(10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Function for Pagination\n",
    "```\n",
    "function getPaginatedResults(pageNumber, pageSize) {\n",
    "    const skip = (pageNumber - 1) * pageSize;\n",
    "    return db.users.find().sort( age: 1 }).skip(skip).limit(pageSize);\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### findOne function\n",
    "The `db.<collectionname>.findOne()` method is used to retrieve a single document from a collection that matches teh specified query criteria. If no provided, it returns the first document in the collection. This method is useful for quickly retrieving a single document without dealing with cursors.\n",

    "## Indexing\n",
    "Indexing is crucial for improving the performance of query operations in MongoDB. Indexes supports the efficient execution of queries by reducing the amont of data that MongoDB needs to scan to find the documents that match the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Indexing\n",
    "1. Faster Query Performance: Indexes significantly speed up read operations by allowing MongoDB to quickly locate the relevant documents.\n",
    "2. Efficient Sorting: Indexes can improve the performance of queries that require sorting.\n",
    "3. Support for Range Queries: Indexes enhance the performance of range queries (e.g., finding documents within a certain range of values).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Indexes\n",
    "indexes can be created on one or more fields in a colleciton. The most common types of indexes are single-field indexes and compound indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-Field Index\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.<collectionname>.createIndex({ fieldname: 1 }) // Ascending order\n",
    "db.<collectionname>.createIndex({ fieldname: -1 }) // Descending order\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.users.createIndex({ age: 1 })\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Compound index\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.<collectionname>.createIndex({ field1: 1, field2: -1 })\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unique Index\n",
    "Indexes in MongoDB are not unique by default. To ensure that a field is unique in a MongoDB colleciton, you need to create a unique index on that field. Unique indexes prevent duplicate values in the indexed field, ensuring that each value is unique across the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Unique Index\n",
    "You can create a unique index using the `createIndex` method with the `unique` option set to `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a Unique Index on a Single Field\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 }, { unique: true })\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a Unique Index on Multipl Fields\n",
    "```\n",
