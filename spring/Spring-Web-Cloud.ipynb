    "# Session\n",
    "Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that each request from a client to a server is independent and should not retain any information about previous interactions. Sessions bridge this gab by maintaining state across multiple requests, allowing the server to recognize users and remember their interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sessions enable web application to keep track of logged-in users, maintaining their authentication state throughout their visit. This persistent state ensures taht users do not need to reauthorize with every new request, thus streamlining user expereience.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is more seucire using sessions, because it is a secure way to handler user data without exposign sensitive information on the client-side. Since session data is stored on the server, it reduces the risk of data being tampered with or accessed by unauthorized third parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSESSIONID\n",
    "JSESSIONID is a unique identifier for a user session. It is stored in a cookie. It allws the server to link a user's HTTP requests to their session data on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "When  session is created, the server generates a `JSESSIONIID` and sends it to the client as a cookie. The client sends this cookies with subsequent requests, allowing the server to maintain user state across multiple requests.\n",

    "- Client-Side Storage: Cookes are small pieces of data stored on the client-side (browser).\n",
    "- State Management: They are used to maintain state between HTTP request since HTTP is stateless.\n",
    "- Usage: Commonly used for storing user preferences, authentication tokens, etc.\n",
    "- Limitations: Since they are stored on the client-side, they can be manipulated and have size limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sessions\n",
    "- Server-Side Storage: Sessions are stored on the server0side and hold information about a user across multiple HTTP requests.\n",
    "- State Management: A session is typically identified by a unique identifier (session ID) which is stored in a cookie (`JSESSIONID`) or URL.\n",
    "- Usage: Used for storing user-specific data that should not be exposed to the client, such as login status, suer preferencs, etc.\n",
    "- Challanges: In a server cluster, sharing session information cna be challanging because session data needs t oe accessible across differetn servers.\n",

    "## Conversational Scope\n",
    "Conversation scope  not a built-in scope in Spring, it refers to managing state across a series of interactions (or conversation) within a user's session. This concept is often implemented using session scoped to store data that needs to persist acrosss multiple requests but not necessarily the entire session.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Spring MVC, conversational scope can be managed using `@SessionAttributes` to handle attributes that need to persist for the duration of a conversation (e.g., a multi-step form process).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### @SessionAttributes\n",
    "The `@SessionAttributes` annotation is used to store model attributes in the HTTP session across multiple requests. It is useful for web applications that require some attributes to persist across multiple requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "How `@SessionAttributes` Works\n",
    "1. Declaration: Use `@SessionAttributes` at the class level in a Spring MVC controller to specify which model attributes should be stored in the session.\n",
    "2. Storage: The specified attributes are stored in the HTTP session when they are first added to the model.\n",
    "3. Access and Update: These attributes can be accessed and updated across multiple requests.\n",
    "4. Removal: Use `SessionStatus.setComplete()` to remove the attributes from the session once the conversation is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Use Case: Multiple-Step Form\n",
    "Controller with `@SessionAttributes`\n",
    "```\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow\n",
    "1. Controller Class: The `UserFormController` class is annotated with `@SessionAttributes(\"userForm\")`, indicating thatthe `userForm` attribute should be stored in the session.\n",
    "2. startForm Mthod: Initializes a new `UserForm` object and adds it to the model. Because of the `@SessionAttributes` annotation, this object will be stored in the session.\n",
    "3. handleStep1 and handleStep2 Methods: Handle the data from the respoective form steps and proceed to the next step. The `UserForm` object is retrieved from the session and updated with each step.\n",
    "4. completeForm Method: Processes teh final step, completes the form submission, and calls `sessionStatus.setComplete()` to remove the `userForm` attribute from the session, ending the conversation.\n",
