    "# Cascade\n",
    "The set of rules that detemines how styling conflicts are resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how cascade resolves conflicts we will look into the following factors:\n",
    "1. Stylesheet origin: When the styles come from. Your styles are applied in conjunction with the browser's default styles.\n",
    "2. Inline styles: Whether a declaration is applied to an element via the HTML style attribute or a CSS selector.\n",
    "3. Layer: Styles can be defined in layers, each with a different priority.\n",
    "4. Selector specificity: Which selectors takes precedence.\n",
    "5. Scope proximity: Whether the styles are scoped to a portion of the DOM.\n",
    "6. Source order: Order in which styles are declared in the stylesheet\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stylesheet Origin\n",
    "This refers to where the styles comes from. There are 3 types:\n",
    "- Author Styles: Styles defined by the developer in CSS files or `<style>` tags within the HTML.\n",
    "- User Styles: Custom styles set by the user, often through browser settings or extensions. They are rare and generally outside your control.\n",
    "- User-Agent Styles: Default styles provided by the browser (eg., default margins, font sizes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Priority Order: Author styles override user-agent styles. User styles, if present, can override author styles unless `!important` is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Author Styles > User Styles > User-Agent Styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inline Styles\n",
    "Styles applied directly to an element using the `style` attribute in HTML have higher priority than those defined in external or internal stylesheets.\n",
    "```\n",
    "<p style=\"color: red;\">this text is red.</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selector Specificity\n",
    "Determines which selectors take precedence based on their specificity value. Specificity is calculated based on the selectors used:\n",
    "- Inline Styles: Highest specificity.\n",
    "- ID Selectors (`#id`): High Specificity.\n",
    "- Class Selectors, Attribute Selectors, Pseudo-classes (`.class`, `[type=\"text\"]`, `:hover`): Medium specificity.\n",
    "- Type Selectors (`element`), Pseudo-elements (`::before`): Low specificity.\n",
    "- Universal Selector (`*`), Combinators (`+`, `>`, `~`), Negation Pseudo-class (`:not()`): No specificity weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "h1 { color: green; }     /* Low specificity */\n",
    ".title { color: blue; }  /* Medium specificity */\n",
    "#page-title { color: red; } /* High specificity */\n",
    "```\n",
    "If an `<h1>` element has both the class `title` and the ID `page-title`, the text color will be red due to the higher specificity of the ID selector.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Source Order\n",
    "When declarations have the same specificity and importance, the one that appears last in the CSS code takes precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "/* Both selectors have equal specificity */\n",
    "p { color: black; }\n",
    "p { color: gray; } /* This rule overrides the previous one */\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Layer\n",
    "CSS allows you to group styles into layers using the `@layer` rule. Layers can be assigned different priporities, giving you more control over how styles override each other.\n",
    "```\n",
    "@layer default {\n",
    "    /* Default styles */\n",
    "    p { color: black; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "@layer theme {\n",
    "    /* Theme-specific styles */\n",
    "    p { color: blue; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Layers defined later can override styles in earlier layers unless specified otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope Proximity\n",
    "Styles scoped to a specific part of the DOM can have higher priority within that scope. This is useful when styles are encapsulated within componets or shadow DOM, ensuring they don't leak out or get overriden by global styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<style scoped>\n",
    "    /* Scoped styles only aply within this component */\n",
    "    p { color: purple; }\n",
    "</style>\n",

    "# Holy Grail Layout\n",
    "The Holy Grail Layout is a classic web design pattern that refers to a page layout with a header, footer, and 3 columns: a fixed-width left sidebar, a flexible central content area, and a fixed-width right sidebar. A flexible central content area, and a fixed-width right sidebar. The sidebars typically contain navigation menus or supplementary content, while the central column holds the main content. The layout is called the \"Holy Grail\" because achieving it with consisent cross-browser compatibility was historically challenging.\n",

    "# Flexbox\n",
    "\n",
    "Is a method of r laying out elements on a page, it's primarily used for arranging elements in a row or column. It excels at distributing space among items and aligning them, making tasks like vertical centering and creating equal-height columns much simpler compared to traditional CSS methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS Flexbox is a powerful layout system in CSS3(Cascading Style Sheets Level 3) designed to arrange and align items within a container efficiently. It provides a more effective way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container--even when their size is unknown or dynamic--making it ideal for responsive design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use Flexbox?\n",
    "- Flexible Layouts: Easily create flexible and responsive layouts without using floats or positioning.\n",
    "- Alignment Control: Precisely control alignment along both horizontal and vertical axis.\n",
    "- Space Distribution: Distribute available space between items or shift them around to create complex layouts.\n",
    "- Order Management: Change the visual order of elements without altering the HTML structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its weakness, is the overwhelming number of options it produces, it introduces more than a dozen new properties to CSS, including some shorthand properties.\n",

    "Flex Container and Flex Items\n",
    "- Flex Container: The parent element with `display: flex;` or `display: inline-flex;` applied.\n",
    "- Flex Items: The direct child elements of a flex container.\n",

    "Example\n",
    "HTML\n",

    "  <div class=\"flex-item\">Item 2</div>\n",

    "```\n",
    ".flex-container {\n",
    "    display: flex;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Applying `display: flex` to an element turns it into a `flex container`, and its direct children into `flex items`. By default, flex items align side by side, left to right, all in one row. The flex container fills the available width like a block element, but the flex items may not necessarily fill the width of their flex container.

    "`flex-basis` property specifies the initial main size of a flex item before any available space is distributed according to the flex factors (`flex-grow` and `flex-shrink`). Essentially, `flex-basis` defines the default size of an element before it adjusts to fill the available space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points about `flex-basis`:\n",
    "- Defines initial Size: Sets the initial lengh of a flex item along the main axis.\n",
    "- Overrides `width` or `height`: If `flex-basis` is set, it overrides the `width` or `height` property (depending on the main axis direction).\n",
    "- Works with `flex` Shorthand: Often used as part of the `flex` shorthand property.\n",
    "- Accepts Various Units: can be specified in pixels (`px`), percentages (`%`), ems (`em`), rems (`rem`), or other CSS units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    ".flex-item {\n",
    "    flex-basis: <length> | auto | content;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `<length>`: Specifies a fixed length. Eg., `flex-basis: 20px;`\n",
    "- `auto` (default): The size is determind by the item's contnet, `width`, or `height`.\n",
    "- `content`: The size is based on the content's intrinsic size (not widely supported yet).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flex Direction\n",
    "Specifies the direction in which the flex items are laid out within a flex container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible Values:\n",
    "```\n",

    "    flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;\n",
    "}\n",

    "# CSS Grid Layout\n",
    "CSS Grid Layout is a powerful 2-dimensional layout system in CSS that allows developers to create complex and responsive web layouts with ease. It enables precise control over rows and colunmns, making it possible to design grid-based layouts without relying on floats, positional, and other older layout method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use CSS Grid?\n",
    "- Two-Dimensional Control: Unlink Flexbox, which this primarily one-dimensional (either row or column), CSS Grid provides control over both rows and columns simultaneously.\n",
    "- Simplifies Complex Layouts: Easily create complex layouts like magazine pages, photo galleries, or dashboard.\n",
    "- Responsive Design: Media queries can adjust the grid layout based on screen size, making responsive design straightforward.\n",
    "- Reduces Markup Compexity: Less need for nested containers or additional elements purely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Concepts\n",
    "Grid Container and Grid \n",
    "- Grid Container: The element on which `display: grid;` is applied. It becomes the grid formatting context for its direct children.\n",
    "- Grid Items: The direct child elements of the grid container. They are placed into the defined grid structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Lines, Tracks, and Cells\n",
    "- Grid Lines: The dividing lines that make up the gird structure (both vertical and horizontal).\n",
    "- Grid Tracks: The space between adjacent grid lines, forming rows or columns.\n",
    "- Grid Cells: The smallest unit on the grid, formed by the intersection of a row and a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Areas\n",
    "- Grid Area: A rectangular space spanning one or more grid cells, defined by specifying grid lines or names.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Grid Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Define the Grid Container\n",

    "# Media Query\n",
    "The `@media` rule in CSS is used to apply styles based on specific media types or conditions, such as screen size, resolution, orientation, or print settings. It's a fundamental tool for creating responsive designs that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is `@media`?\n",
    "- Media Queries: The `@media` rule allows you to define media queries, which are logical expressions that determine when certain styles should be applied.\n",
    "- Conditional Styling: Styles enclosed within `media` block are applied only if the specified conditions are met.\n",
    "- Responsive Design: By using media queries, you can create layouts that respond to the user's device, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.\n",

    "# Breakpoints\n",
    "A breakpoint in web design refers to specific screen widths (or viewport sizes) at which a website's layout adapts to provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices. Breakpoints are a fundamental concept in responsive design, allowing developers to adjust styles and layouts to accommodate different screen sizes, orientations, and resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts of Breakpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Media Queries\n",
    "- Breakpoints are implemented using CSS media queries, which apply CSS rules based on conditions such as screen width, height, resolution, and orientation.\n",
    "- Media queries use the `@media` rule to include a block of CSS properties only if certain conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fluid and Adaptive Layouts\n",
    "- Fluid Layouts: Use relative units like percentages (`%`) or viewport units (`vw`, `vh`) to allow elements to resize based on the viewport.\n",
    "- Adaptive Layouts: Use breakpoints to apply different fixed layouts for specific screen sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mobile-First Approach\n",
    "- Start designing for the smallest screen sizes and progressively enhance the design for larger screens.\n",
    "- Use `min-width` in media queries to apply styles when the viewport reaches a certain width.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing Breakpoints with Media Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax of Media Queries\n",
    "```\n",
    "@media (condition) {\n",
    "    /* CSS rules */\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Common Conditions:\n",
    "- `max-width`: Applies styles up to a maximum width.\n",
    "- `min-width`: Applies styles from a minimum width upward.\n",
    "- `orientation`: Applies styles based on device orientation (`portrait` or `landscape`).\n",
    "\n",
    " Example Breakpoints\n",
    " ```\n",
    "/* Mobile devices (default styles) */\n",

    "# Mobile-First\n",
    "Mobile-first approach is a strategy in web design and development where designing for mobile devices is prioritized before scaling up to larger screens like tablets and desktops.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 key principles of responsive design:\n",
    "- A mobile-first approach to design: This means you have a plan for the mobile version before you begin constructing the desktop layout.\n",
    "- The @media at-rule: With this rule, you can tailor your styles fo viewports of different sizes. This syntax (often called media queries) lets you write styles that only apply under certain conditions.\n",
    "- The use of fluid layouts: This approach allows containers to scale to different sizes based on the width of the viewport.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Principles of Mobile-first Design\n",
    "- Content Prioritization\n",
    "- - Focus on essential content and features due to limited screen space.\n",
    "  - Eliminate unnecessary elements that could clutter the interface.\n",
    "- Progressive Enhancement\n",
    "- - Start with a basic, functional design for mobile devices.\n",
    "  - Add more complex features and enhancements for larger screens.\n",
    "- Responsive Design\n",
    "- - Used flexible layouts, images, and CSS media queries to adapt to various screen sizes.\n",
    "  - Ensure a consistent user experience across all devices.\n",
    "- Performance Optimization\n",
    "- - Optimize images, scripts, and stylesheets to reduce load times on mobile networks.\n",
    "  - Minimize the use of heavy resources that can slow down mobile performance.\n",
    "- Touch-Friendly Interactions\n",
    "- - Design buttons and interactive elements that are easy to tap with finters.\n",
    "  - Provide adequate spacing to prevent accidental touches.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want the most important content to appear first in the HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing the HTML for a responsive design, it's important to ensure it has everything you need for each screen size. You can apply different CSS for each instance, but you must all share the same HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering your design for larger viewports, you will code the mobile layout first, initially writing the CSS needed only for smaller screens. Before diving into that, however, it's helpful to keep in mind your overall design as you will want it on larger screens.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you pu the mobile styles in place, you'll add a medium and large breakpoint on your page. You'll do this by using media queries to layer on additional styles that will only apply on larger screen sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a class class when buton is clicked. The following when the button with id `toggle-menu` is clicked, it adds the class `is-open` to the element with id `main-menu`\n",
    "```\n",
    "    <script type=\"module\">\n",
    "      var button = document.getElementById('toggle-menu');\n",
    "      button.addEventListener('click', function(event) {\n",
    "        event.preventDefault();\n",
    "        var menu = document.getElementById('main-menu');\n",
    "        menu.classList.toggle('is-open');\n",
    "      });\n",
    "    </script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding viewport meta tag\n",
    "The `meta` tag is an essential part of responsive web design, especially for mobile devices. It instructs the browser on how to control the pages dimensions and scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "it is an HTML tag that thells mobile devices you've intentionally designed for small screens. Without it mobile browser assumes your page is not responsive, and it will attempt to emulate a desktop browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "On mobile devices, browsers renders web pages differently than on desktop browsers. by default, mobile browsers display web pages with a viewport width of about 980 pixels and scale down the content to fit smaller screens. This behaviour can make websites designed for desktop appear too small and difficult to read on mobile devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    <meta name=\"viewport\"\n",
    "      content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. `width=device-width`: Sets the width of the page to match the screen width of the device.\n",
    "2. `initial-scal=1`: Sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded to 1 (no zoom)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Without it, mobile browsers often default to rendering pages at a larger sesktop width (typically around 980px) and then shrinking it to fit.\n",
    "- This can make your mobile site look tiny and hard to read.\n",
    "- With this tag, your page will render at the appropriate width for hte device and your responsive CSS will work as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is considered best practice to include this tag in the `<head>` section of all modern responsive website.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Media queries\n",
    "Media queries allow you to write a set of styles that only apply to the page under certain conditions. this lets you tailor your styles differenetly, based on the screen size. You can define a set of styles that apply to small devices, another set for medium-sized devices, and yet a third set for large screens to allow for laying out parts of the page differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Media queries use the `media` at-rule to target devices that match a specified feature. A basic media query looks like the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "@media (min-width: 560px) {\n",
    "    .title > h1 {\n",
    "        font-size: 2.25rem;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `@media` rule is a conditional check that must be true for any of these styles to be applied to the page. In this case, the browser checks for a `min-width: 560px`. The larger font size of .5 rem will only be applied to the title's h1 element if the user's device has a viewport width of 560px or greater. If the viewport is less than this, the rules inside are ignored."
