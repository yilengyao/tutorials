    "The CSS box model consists of 4 parts.\n",
    "1. Content: This area is the inner rectangle of the box, consisting of the content--such as some text or an image--that's contained within the box.\n",
    "2. Padding: This area between the content and the border represents extra whitespace added outside the top, right, bottom, and left edges of the content area.\n",
    "3. Border: This part turns along the outer edges of the padding area and surrounds the content and padding with lines.\n",
    "4. Margin: This area is the outer rectangle of the box, representing extra whitespace added outside of the top, right, bottom, and left borders.\n",

    "`box-sizing` property in CSS defines how the total width and height of an element are calculated. By Default, CSS uses the `content-box` model, which can sometimes lead to unpredictable result, setting `box-sizing: border-box;` leads to more predictable result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `box-sizing` property controls how the total width and height of an element are calculated. It can take one of two values:\n",
    "1. `content-box` (default): The width and height include only the content. Padding and border are added outside the content's dimentsions, increasing the total size.\n",
    "2. `border-box`: The width and height include the content, padding, and border. Padding and border are inside the box, reducing the content area to maintain the specified dimentsions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does `box-sizing: border-box;` do?\n",
    "When you set `box-sizing: border-box;`, you change the box model calculation so that:\n",
    "- Total Width: includes content width, padding, and border.\n",
    "- Total Height: Includes content height, padding and border.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that hte specified `width` and `height` properties define the total size of the element, and padding and borders are drawn inside this area.\n",
    "\n",
